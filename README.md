# Requirements for the React test

- Please use JavaScript (and do not use TypeScript)

- Try to reproduce the given design. It does not have to be perfect, the design itself has minor mistakes too. If you spot any, feel free to make note of them (this is not required). 

- Use React as a frontend system.

- Functional requirements:
  - Create a listing page
  - Hovering over the ? should show a bit if info (example on one of the screens)
  - "Add to Cart" button should work and on every item
  - Cart to display the amount of items in it, and it's total
  - Cart should have an show/hide feature on click

- What is not required:
  - Removing from the cart
  - Checkout button (but if it leads to a different page its a plus)
  - You can use your own assets/items, you don't have to use the give phone assets
